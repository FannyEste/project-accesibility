# project-accessibility

We had to make one of our projects accessible, following the accessibility guidelines, getting an score of at least 95 in Lighthouse, semantic HTML elements, images with alt attributes and proper size, clean code and correct contrast and make it responsive

The problem
I tried to use one of my previous projects because I did some designes myself and I wanted to inprove it, but it became very messy at the end and I lost a lot of time, sometimes the Lighthouse score was appearing over 95 and then droppiing to 70 whem I was opening it in another tab, so at the end I decided to start from scratch with a very simple website, but adding a background image to ajust it to the size and save it in the correct format. 
I used my past projects to get some code and styling, If I had more time, I would add more functions, images, videos and elements that can be tricky with accesibility to find the way to fix it properly
